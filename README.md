## Development server

Suggestion by Markus: Just run `npm start` to run the server and then navigate as stated below.

Autogenerated: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Adding new route

1. Add route to `app.module.ts`.
2. Just link to the route e.g. by `a href="/customers"` for the route `customers`.

## Add material component

1. Find needed component by using a search engine ;) (e.g. https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview)
2. Go to "API" and find the import statement and add it to `app.module.ts` (or add just the component to the exising import statement `@angular/material`. 
3. Also add the component to the `imports:` in `app.module.ts`.
4. Use the component anywhere in the appplication.
